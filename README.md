Water Quality Index Prediction for Niger Delta Rivers Using ML and XGBoost

This project applies machine learning and XGBoost to predict the Water Quality Index (WQI) of Niger Delta rivers using synthetic environmental data. It demonstrates how data-driven models can support water resource monitoring and pollution assessment.

📌 Project Objectives

Generate realistic synthetic river water-quality data

Compute Water Quality Index (WQI)

Train an XGBoost regression model for WQI prediction

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
